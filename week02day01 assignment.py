Question 1: Play with repl while running commands and operators.
ans -       repl stands for read evaluate print loop.
1)read     -The read function accepts an expression from the user, and 
             parses it into a data structure in memory.
2)evaluate -The eval function takes this internal data structure and 
             evaluates it .
3)print    -The print function takes the result yielded by eval, and 
             prints it out to the user.
4)loop     -until desired output is reached the above functions are 
             repeated again and again with loop function.

 Question 2: Given a no print its remainder. Which command will you use ? 
 ans-        To find the remainder for the given divison we use the modulus
              operator % .the example of the same is given below.                             
'''
a=int(input("enter 1st number "))
b=int(input("enter 2nd number "))
c=a%b
print(c)
'''
3) Experiment with str concatenation.
The strcat function is used to 
concatenate one string (source) at the 
end of another string (destination).its functions are

Takes the destination string.
Finds the NULL character.
Copies the source string starting at the location of the 
NULL character of destination string.
Appends a NULL character to the destination string when 
all characters of the source string are copied to the destination string.

remaining 2 questions are practical oriented hence i have not included them in
this assignment.
